# Fake Data Modeling
Python file to insert 1M rows: https://github.com/dalepercelay/DASS-Fighting-Maddness/blob/main/src/localdatabase.py
In this file, we create 100,000 users, 400,000 animals, and 20,000 enemies. Since we create 100,000 users and 400,000 animals, we also insert 500,000 rows into transactions to model the starting gold and health. We believe our service should scale in this way because each user can have multiple animals and we thought 4 animals / user was a good average evening out for those who may only have 1 vs those who may buy many many animals. 20,000 just seemed like a good number for enemies to add variety since in our endpoints we never add/kill enemies (just a preset pool of potential enemies). The other tables such as fights and animals_owned depend on the endpoints such as buying animals or creating a fight so we did not insert fake model data. In total, we create 1,020,000 rows of data.

# Performance results of hitting endpoints
## Slowest endpoints (slowest to fastest): get inventory, create animal, leaderboard
## Endpoint timings:
1. Get inventory: 438.818ms
2. Restore Health: 149.838ms
3. Catalog: 101.665ms
4. Create user: 104.404ms
5. Create animal: 209.707ms
6. Buy animal: 75.843ms
7. Leaderboard: 166.538ms
8. Fight: 79.788ms

# Performance tuning
Get inventory
Explain results:
1. Seq Scan on animals_owned
2. Parallel Seq Scan on transactions
3. Index Scan using animal_pkey on animals
4. Parallel Seq Scan on transactions
Create index SQL:
1. CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_user_id ON transactions(user_id);
2. CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_animal_id ON transactions(animal_id);
Explain results (after creating index):
1. Seq Scan on animals_owned
2. Index Scan using idx_transactions_user_id on transactions
3. Index Scan using animal_pkey on animals
4. Index Scan using idx_transactions_animal_id on transactions
Performance improved?: yes

Create animal
Explain results:
1. Parallel Seq Scan on animals
2. Insert on animals
3. Insert on transactions
Create index SQL:
1. CREATE INDEX idx_animals_name ON animals(UPPER(name));
Explain results (after creating index):
1. Bitmap Heap Scan on animals
2. Insert on animals
3. Insert on transactions
Performance improved?: yes

Leaderboard
Explain results:
1. Sort Method: top-N heapsort Memory
2. Hash aggregate on users.name
3. Parallel seq scan on users 
4. Parallel seq scan on transactions
Create index SQL:
1. CREATE INDEX idx_users_name ON users (name);
2. CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_gold ON transactions (gold);
Explain results (after creating index):
1. Index scan on transactions
2. Group aggregate on users.name
3. Index Scan on users

Performance improved?: yes
