GROUP PROJECT USER STORIES AND EXCEPTIONS
CAL POLY CREATURES 

1. As an incoming Cal Poly student, I want to understand the wildlife and domesticated animals around the campus. 
Exception: The database does not describe a complete catalog of the animals on campus.

2. As an animal rights activist, I want to see which animals are being domesticated on a publicly funded campus. 
Exception: The data does not account for what the animals are being used for, i.e. farming, sanctuary, nurturing, racing, etc.

3. As an insect enthusiast, I want to see a specific type of cricket Cal Poly has!
Exception: Not all crickets may be listed in the catalog, so instead, if data isn’t found, a message can be provided of “Data unavailable for [insert name]”

4. As a horse lover, I want to check out the different horses we have!
Exception: We may not have up to date data on where the horses are, so we should put a disclaimer that the locations we have down are just ‘general’ usually found in locations.

5. As a bored student, I want to explore locations on campus to find creatures.
Exception: There’s a location on campus that does not have any creatures, and so when they search up that location no results are returned. We should return something along the lines of “No animals have been found here yet…let us know if you do find one in your exploration”

6. As an animal studies student, I want to search data to explore what types of animals live in the Cal Poly ecosystem,
Exception: Domesticated animals may skew the results of the ecosystem data, so there should be an option to filter out domesticated animals.

7. As a person searching for a pet to raise, I want to explore what animals I can raise that are not invasive to the ecosystem.
Exception: Some animals may be too illegal to raise as a pet (i.e. snake). Therefore, when searching for pets there should be classifications on whether or not it is feasible to raise it based on CA laws.

8. As a student allergic to cats, I want to know what areas to avoid so I don’t get itchy.
Exception: The database does not account for species of cat and I am only allergic to certain species, so I don’t know which ones to avoid. Perhaps suggest to filter by specific species type if they are searching for allergies.

9. As a veterinarian student, I want to know the types of animals that I need to know how to protect in my area
Exception: There may be no data on endangerment level for these animals, so in our database we should put a column for endangerment level and fill it out if we have the data/user can update the data.

10. As an animal hater, I need to know places to avoid so I don’t stumble upon an animal. 
Exception: An animal showed up in a place that the database said there were no animals. This was highly upsetting. Give the user the option to add this animal to the database or update the location information.

11. As a dog owner, I want to meet other dog owners so I can have someone to talk to while my dog plays in the fields.
Exception: Other dog owners are not consistently in the same place, so I went to where the database said there were a lot of dogs, but there were none. Put a disclaimer that locations are general and not specifically accurate to the time.

12. As a snake hater, I want to know all different species and locations of snakes so I can safely avoid them while hiking!
Exception: the locations may not always be completely accurate because weather can affect the creatures, therefore, there will be a disclaimer on the fact that the locations are just common places snakes are found.
