}

**Create User - POST Method `/user/create`**

Request:

```
{
	“name”: “string”
}
```

Response:

```
{
	“user_id”: “integer”
}
```

**Buy an Animal - PUT Method `/animal/buy`**
Description: Buy an animal (if the user has enough gold). Return True if delivery was successful (user had enough gold to buy) otherwise False. (An animal starts with 100 health. If their health gets <=10, a user can restore the animal's health, otherwise the animal will be unable to fight)
Request:

```
{
	“animal_id”: "integer"
	"user_id": "integer"
}
```

Response:

```
{
	“delivery-status”: “boolean”
}
```

**Create a Fight - POST Method `/fight`**
Description: Users can initiate fights with preset enemies to earn gold. Users will pay any amount of gold (basically betting in your luck) in order to participate in the fight. A random enemy will be picked out in the database table called Enemies to fight, and they will have their own respective stats, health, and name.

There will be three rounds of fighting total. Each round, for both sides, there will be a probability from 1 - 35 and whatever that number is, it will be subtracted from the main health points. Whoever has the lowest amount of health by the end of the three rounds will be the winner, and of course if one side has less than 0 or reached 0 health points, then automatically the other side wins. The 1 - 35 is just an average range of health points you can lose in one round. The higher the defense and attack stats are, the lower the range can go to decrease the amount of health points you lose. Vice versa for the lower the defense and attack stats are, the higher the range of points you can lose will be.

Winning the fight would allow them to earn money based on how much they choose to bet their gold by 10. For example, if a user bet 10 gold and won the battle, then they can get 100 gold total from the battle (aka bonus) plus 10 gold as a base congratulations reward. If they lose the fight though, they just lose the gold they originally bet in the first place. Furthermore, if they lose, their animal' health is decreased by 20.

Additionally, if their animal is too weak (health is less than or equal to 10) because the user hasn't restocked them, they will be unable to fight!!

Request:

```
{
	“user_id”: “integer”
	"animal_id": integer"
